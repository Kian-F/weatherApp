## Instructions

- For the purpose of this coding test build a ReactJS application that allows users to search for locations, and then retrieve weather information about that location. One source of this information, for both a location search and related weather information, is the Meta weather API that is documented at https://www.metaweather.com/api/#locationsearch.

- Note that CORS has not been enabled on the server side, if you are using Chrome please use extension like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en for development only (may affect other sites).

## Motivation
The following should be delivered as part of this test:

- A “home page” where the user can search by location name (e.g "San") via a search box. The search results after a search should be displayed as list. Each search result should display the title, location type, latitude and longitude of the location. Clicking on a location should open the details page described below
- A “details page” which displays the location name, weather information, and anything else you may find interesting about that location
- ReactJS must used to create the app
- Use a state management library of your choice
- The application must be responsive
- Refrain from using any boilerplate other than create-react-app

## Technologies
