## Introduction
This app's development was a part of a job process and application. The app successfully implemented and meet all the requirements. Unfortunately the job cancelled due to COVID-19.

#### [Live Site - hosted on Heroku](https://weather-simple--react.herokuapp.com/#/).

## Motivation
The following should be delivered as part of this test:

- A “home page” where the user can search by location name (e.g "San") via a search box. The search results after a search should be displayed as list. Each search result should display the title, location type, latitude and longitude of the location. Clicking on a location should open the details page described below

- A “details page” which displays the location name, weather information, and anything else you may find interesting about that location

- ReactJS must used to create the app

- Use a state management library of your choice

- The application must be responsive

- Refrain from using any boilerplate other than create-react-app
